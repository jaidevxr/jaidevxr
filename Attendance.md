# Employee Attendance Tracking App

## Key Features

### Geolocation-Based Check-In and Check-Out

- Use geofencing to detect when an employee enters or leaves a specified radius (200 meters) around the office.
- Automatically log the time and location for check-ins and check-outs.
- Pair each check-in with a corresponding check-out to ensure accurate records.

### Manual Location Check-In / Check-Out for Offsite Work

- Provide a manual option for employees to check in and out when working remotely or at different locations.
- Suggest nearby locations based on the employeeâ€™s current geolocation.
- Allow employees to confirm their check-in and check-out at these suggested locations.

### Total Working Hours Calculation

- Calculate the total working hours based on check-in and check-out records.
- Ensure accurate calculation even with multiple entries and exits.

### Data Accuracy and Integrity

- Ensure real-time data synchronization and secure storage.
- Use encryption and secure authentication to protect data from tampering and loss.

## Implementation Plan

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native or Flutter for cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js, or Python with Django/Flask.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing attendance records.
- **Geolocation:** Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap for geolocation services.
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication or OAuth 2.0 for secure login.

### Development Steps

#### a. Setup and Configuration

- Initialize the mobile app project using React Native or Flutter.
- Set up the backend server with Node.js or Python and connect it to the database.

#### b. Geofencing Implementation

- Integrate geolocation services to track employee location.
- Set up geofencing to detect when an employee enters or leaves the 200-meter radius of the office.

#### c. Manual Check-In/Out Feature

- Implement a feature for manual check-in/out with location suggestions.
- Use reverse geocoding to suggest relevant locations based on current coordinates.

#### d. Attendance Logging and Calculation

- Create endpoints in the backend to log check-in and check-out times with locations.
- Implement logic to pair check-ins with check-outs and calculate total working hours.

#### e. Data Security and Synchronization

- Ensure secure data transmission using HTTPS.
- Use database encryption and secure authentication mechanisms to protect data.
- Implement real-time synchronization to keep records updated across devices.

#### f. Testing and Deployment

- Test the app thoroughly for geolocation accuracy, data integrity, and performance.
- Deploy the backend on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud).
- Publish the mobile app on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
